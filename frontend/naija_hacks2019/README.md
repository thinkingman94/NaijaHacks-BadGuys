# Problem

Insecurity in Nigeria is a long age issue.
Many cases of kidnaps and abductions among both high class and low class citizens.
Inadequate systems to checkmate insecurity on all levels

# Proposed Solution

An app that helps to secure individuals 
by employing their most used device - the mobile phone 
to track their movements and the movement of their loved ones (Traque)

# Proposed Stack

Adobe XD, Flutter, Nexmo, Android Studio, Linode, Mongodb, Dart

# Benefits

- People will feel more secured knowing that they are being tracked by their loved ones
- People can now monitor their loved ones as well.
- SOS attributes to send signals incase of emergency or theft
- Theft cases will reduce drastically when people know phones now serve as tracking devices
